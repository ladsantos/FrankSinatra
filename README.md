Yet another code to compute radial velocities of massive objects orbiting each other. This code takes as input the orbital parameters of the system and spits out the radial velocities of the main massive object in the time stamps provided by the user.

I wrote this code when I needed to calculate radial velocities of an exoplanet orbiting its main star. This radial velocities were then used to shift the observed spectra to the reference frame of the planet and then compute the transmission spectrum of the planet when it transited its host star.
